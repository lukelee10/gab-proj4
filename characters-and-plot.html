                <h1>The Start of an Era</h1>
                <p> Born in Liverpool, Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze as a teenager. In 1957, he formed his first band, the Quarrymen, which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. He was initially the group's de facto leader, a role gradually ceded to McCartney. Starting in 1967, Lennon's lyrics began to espouse a pacifist message, and some of his songs were soon adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger counterculture. From 1968 to 1972, he produced more than a dozen records with Ono, including a trilogy of avant-garde albums, his first solo LP John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band, and the international top 10 singles "Give Peace a Chance", "Instant Karma!", "Imagine" and "Happy Xmas (War Is Over)".</p>

                  <h2>John and Paul</h2>
                  <p>At age 15, Lennon formed a skiffle group, the Quarrymen. Named after Quarry Bank High School, the group was established by Lennon in September 1956.[35] By the summer of 1957, the Quarrymen played a "spirited set of songs" made up of half skiffle and half rock and roll.[36] Lennon first met Paul McCartney at the Quarrymen's second performance, which was held in Woolton on 6 July at the St Peter's Church garden fÃªte. Lennon then asked McCartney to join the band.[37]</p>

                  <h2>Forming The Beatles</h2>
                  <p>McCartney recommended his friend George Harrison to be the lead guitarist.[43] Lennon thought that Harrison, then 14 years old, was too young. McCartney engineered an audition on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus, where Harrison played "Raunchy" for Lennon and was asked to join.[44] Stuart Sutcliffe, Lennon's friend from art school, later joined as bassist.[45] Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Sutcliffe became "The Beatles" in early 1960.</p>

                    <h2>'Revolver' (1966)</h2>
                    <p class="topFour">No band has ever achieved, or will ever achieve, what the Beatles accomplished between June 1965 and April 1967, when they recorded the songs that would make up their three greatest albums, which also happen to rank among the best LPs ever made. From McCartney's string-guided lament "Eleanor Rigby" to the bubbling playfulness of "Yellow Submarine" to Lennon's closing mind-screwing freak-out "Tomorrow Never Knows," 'Revolver' is a thrilling and revolutionary piece of music-making that turned pop music on its head with its innovative uses of loops, backward tapes and overdubs.</p>

                    <h2>'Rubber Soul' (1965) </h2>
                   <p class="topFour"> If 'Help!' hinted at the Beatles' creative growth, 'Rubber Soul' made it clear: They were no longer just a pop group. From the deeply confessional to the poignantly nostalgic, the band's sixth album is one of rock's most important and influential works, the moment where the music, and its most significant group, grew up.</p>
